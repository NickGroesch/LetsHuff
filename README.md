# **Let's Huff!**

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a web app that lets users view, save, and leave comments on the latest news, scraped straight from the Huffington Post.

## But ... **Why?**

Due of the physiological and psychological changes induced by Huffing the news, there are times that it is inappropriate for users to Huff, e.g., behind the wheel (NEVER HUFF AND DRIVE!), in the presence of minors, when excessively hungry (Hangry Huffing is not advised). But since as Taylor Swift never sang, _Huffers gonna Huff, Huff, Huff, Huff, Huff_, heavy Huffers often need a way to satisfy their headline hunger, but save their Huffing for a more appropriate occasion (much as an addict's neurons are temporarily stimulated by seeing the image of their paraphanalia of choice). Thus **Let's Huff!** was born.

## User Stories

##### By, _the edu-team_

1. Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of developer's choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to your application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

   - Headline - the title of the article
   - Summary - a short summary of the article (Which was a problem. Because Huffpost tends not to do summaries, this user story lacks the usual happy ending. But I'm **so committed to Huff** I did it anyway.)
   - URL - the url to the original article

2. Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
